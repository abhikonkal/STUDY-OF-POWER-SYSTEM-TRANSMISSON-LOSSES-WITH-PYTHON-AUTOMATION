# STUDY-OF-POWER-SYSTEM-TRANSMISSON-LOSSES-WITH-PYTHON-AUTOMATION




Studying the transmisson losses across the 400kV_Chandrapur_Badhravati Line_4 

# The objectives are :
## To Study and Plot the data of different transmission lines and calculate the losses.
## Plot this data in Day wise, Season wise and in other format.
## Study this data and different plots.
## To develop the pattern and arrived at methodology;
      a) To choose different types of conductors for different objective and optimise the process
      b) Try to separate ‘Technical’ and ‘Instrumental’ losses.
      c) To automate the above process.
